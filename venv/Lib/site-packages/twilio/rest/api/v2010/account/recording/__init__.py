        Asynchronously streams RecordingInstance records from the API as a generator stream.
        This operation lazily loads records as efficiently as possible until the limit
        is reached.
        The results are returned as a generator, so this operation is memory efficient.

Specify a date as `YYYY-MM-DD` in GMT, for example: `2009-07-06`, to read recordings that were created on this date. You can also specify an inequality, such as `DateCreated<=YYYY-MM-DD`, to read recordings that were created on or before midnight of this date, and `DateCreated>=YYYY-MM-DD` to read recordings that were created on or after midnight of this date.
        :param datetime date_created_before: Only include recordings that were created on this date. Specify a date as `YYYY-MM-DD` in GMT, for example: `2009-07-06`, to read recordings that were created on this date. You can also specify an inequality, such as `DateCreated<=YYYY-MM-DD`, to read recordings that were created on or before midnight of this date, and `DateCreated>=YYYY-MM-DD` to read recordings that were created on or after midnight of this date.
        :param datetime date_created_after: Only include recordings that were created on this date. Specify a date as `YYYY-MM-DD` in GMT, for example: `2009-07-06`, to read recordings that were created on this date.

        :param bool include_soft_deleted: A boolean parameter indicating whether to retrieve soft deleted recordings or not. Recordings metadata are kept after deletion for a retention period of 40 days.
